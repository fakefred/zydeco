# Syntax CheatSheet

## Before we start

(The actually title should be *Nagging and Ranting*)

Not expecting our reader to parse a whole ebnf in seconds - if that's the case she'd better just read `compiler/src/parse/parser.lalrpop`, which is pretty close to the spec already. The cheatsheet is more example focused by traversing the syntax tree and give examples along the way. But yes, an ebnf would definitely be helpful, so it's still on the todo-list, only with a lower priority.

If I ever need to draw a table I'll use `org-mode` instead of some html dialect.
